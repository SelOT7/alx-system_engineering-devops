### Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
## Description
This is a 3-server web infrastructure that is secured, monitored, and serves encrypted traffic.

##  About This Infrastructure
**What are firewalls for**
* We added firewalls to control traffic and for better security. We also added monitoring tools, that will monitor our application and also our server for a better performance and data collector.
* Firewalls are software or hardware that prevent unauthorized access to a network.It checks the coming and going data, based on predefined rules. If that data abides by the rules then it will be allowed to enter.

**Why is the traffic served over HTTPS**
HTTPS is a secure form of HTTP. It uses data encryption to transfer data from one to another. When HTTPS request is sent, public key with SSL certification are sent back from the server. The client does SSL handshake, which means the client also shows it credentials that matches the SSL certificate. This then allows the data to be decrypted in the clients machine.
